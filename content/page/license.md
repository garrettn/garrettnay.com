## Why?

The real question is why not? I don't really stand to gain anything by
restricting the license, and I generally believe that the Web is a better place
when people are allowed to share, reuse, and remix things. I've been inspired by
[other](https://www.codesections.com/license/)
[sites](https://www.jonobacon.com/2016/08/12/my-blog-is-creative-commons-licensed/)
that similarly offer free licenses to their content, and I want to do the same
thing. If you find something on this site that's useful to you, I don't want to
stand in the way of your making something great out of it!
