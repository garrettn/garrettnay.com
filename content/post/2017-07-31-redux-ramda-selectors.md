I love Redux. Big deal, right? [A lot of people do](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/stargazers). But seriously, Redux provides a great system for managing state in complex JavaScript applications. Not only that, but it was also the first Flux-like library that I really felt I understood.

I also love [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/). [I'm definitely not the only one there either](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/stargazers), although it's not quite on the same level of popularity as Redux. That's a shame, because the two libraries can work really well together. Although they serve two very different purposes, their ultimate goal is the same, which is to help you write more functional and declarativeâ„¢ JavaScript applications.

In this article I want to show one area where Ramda can improve your Redux app: selector functions.

When you hear Ramda described as a functional JavaScript utility library, you may be tempted to think it's just a Lodash clone. But let me tell you, it is much more than that.
